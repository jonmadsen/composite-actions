      # TODO:  This is no good, this means that if say we had a action package published of
      # version 1.0.5, that this would always refer to the actions of master, and master could
      # be at a later version say 2.0.0, so eessentially this use is not guaranteed to reference
      # an action in the same release that it is published in unless the published release being
      # used is always the latest.
      # Ideally we would just reference the local action, and when the release was packaged
      # it would always reference that, or we somehow tie the release version into this
      # reference like `jonmadsen/composite-actions/gradleEnv@<Version Variable>
